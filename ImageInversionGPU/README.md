# Image Inversion on Webcam Feed Using CUDA and OpenCV

The Image Inversion Process is quite a common practice in Medical Imaging, where the scans give out images that are not very easily comprehensible by the human eye. To overcome this issue Image Inversion is carried out, that increases the contrast in the image and improves readability.

## Execution of the Code (In a linux based OS):

```
$ cd </path/to/the/location/of/the/program>
$ make
$ ./one.out
```


**Note: You might want to change the architecture specific flags in the Makefile if your GPU has a different compute and sm architecture.**
