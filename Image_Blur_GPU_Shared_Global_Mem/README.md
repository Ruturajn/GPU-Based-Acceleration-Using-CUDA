# Image Blurring Operation on Images using CUDA and OpenCV

This code blurs an input image by convolving it with a given filter. All of this is done by harnessing the GPU compute capability using CUDA.

## Execution of the Code (In a Linux based OS):

```
$ cd </path/to/the/location/of/the/program>
$ make
$ ./one.out
```

**Note: You might want to change the architecture specific flags in the Makefile if your GPU has a different compute and sm architecture.**
